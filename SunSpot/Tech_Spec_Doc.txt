Technical Specification Document for Tron-Based Trading Platform

1. Overview
1.1 Project Description
The project aims to develop a decentralized trading platform on the Tron blockchain. This platform will enable users to trade TRX and TRC20 tokens with low transaction fees, secure fund management, and a user-friendly interface. Integration with Sunpump will enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs, making the platform attractive to both retail and institutional traders.
1.2 Goals and Objectives
 Primary Goals:
 Develop a secure and scalable trading platform on the Tron blockchain.
 Integrate Sunpump to reduce transaction fees and manage liquidity.
 Deliver a real-time trading experience with an intuitive user interface.
 Secondary Goals:
 Ensure compatibility with major Tron wallets (TronLink, TronWallet, Math Wallet).
 Implement advanced security features, including optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
 Provide responsive customer support and detailed analytics for users.

2. Architecture
2.1 System Architecture
 Frontend: The frontend will be developed using React. It will interact with the backend and the Tron blockchain through RESTful APIs and WebSockets for real-time updates.
 Backend: The backend will be built using Node.js with Express.js, handling user requests, trade processing, and interactions with the MongoDB database.
 Blockchain: Smart contracts deployed on the Tron blockchain will manage trades, token transfers, and Sunpump transactions.
 Database: MongoDB will be used to store user data, transaction history, and platform settings.
Diagrams Needed:
