8. Post-Launch Support and Maintenance
 Duration: Ongoing
 Tasks:
 Provide technical support to users.
 Regularly update the platform with new features and security patches.
 Output: A well-maintained, continually improving trading platform.
Total Estimated Time: 15 weeks (Approximately 3-4 months)
This timeline assumes a standard workload and average learning curve. If you are new to blockchain development or some of the technologies involved, it might take longer. Additionally, you may choose to run some phases in parallel if you have a team, which could shorten the overall duration.
Step 6: Review and Finalize the Plan
1. Conduct a Comprehensive Review
1.1 Review the Technical Specification Document
 Content Verification: A summary of key areas in the Technical Specification Document (TSD) was reviewed to ensure all features, architecture, and processes are clearly defined and accurate.
 Technical Feasibility: The selected technology stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB, TronWeb, Sunpump SDK) is suitable and feasible for the project.
 Risk Assessment: Existing risks and their mitigation strategies were confirmed to be comprehensive, with no new risks needing reassessment.
 Timeline and Milestones: The current project timeline and milestones were reviewed and confirmed to be realistic and achievable.
2. Review Project Management Setup
2.1 Trello Board Structure
 The Trello board is properly set up with all necessary lists (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) and major tasks added as cards.
2.2 Task Assignments
 Suggested Task Distribution:
 Frontend Development: Assigned to Frontend Developer(s).
 Backend Development: Assigned to Backend Developer(s).
 Smart Contract Development: Assigned to Blockchain Developer(s).
 Sunpump Integration: Assigned to Blockchain Developer(s).
 Testing and QA: Assigned to QA Engineer(s).
 Project Management: Assigned to the Project Manager.
2.3 Milestones in Trello
 Milestones and task dependencies are clearly represented in Trello, with no additional milestones needed.
3. Stakeholder Alignment
3.1 Stakeholder Review
 The plan will be reviewed with stakeholders immediately.
3.2 Feedback Incorporation
 Feedback will be compiled during the stakeholder review and addressed in a follow-up session.
3.3 Approval
 Final approval will be sought after the follow-up session, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned with the project's goals, scope, and timeline.

Step 7: Testing and QA
1. Develop a Testing Plan
1.1 Types of Tests
 Proceeding with Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Security Testing, and Performance Testing.
1.2 Testing Environment
 In-House Setup: The testing environment will be set up in-house to closely mirror the production setup, including a Tron testnet for smart contract deployment.
1.3 Test Cases and Scripts
 Automation Focus: Testing will prioritize automation from the start to ensure efficiency and consistency.
1.4 Bug Tracking and Reporting
 Trello for Bug Tracking: Trello will be used for tracking bugs and managing test results.
1.5 Final QA Review
 Proceeding with the final QA review, including comprehensive testing and sign-off once all critical bugs are resolved.

Step 8: Deployment and Launch
1. Prepare for Deployment
1.1 Deployment Environment
 You will review cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) before making a final decision.
1.2 Smart Contract Deployment
 A final audit of smart contracts will be conducted before deploying them to the Tron mainnet.
